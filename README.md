# Bukva
A program that allows you to type cyrillic characters anywhere on your computer using an english keyboard. Works just like translit.net.

# Installation
The program is in one executable located in the Compiled directory. Just choose your version of .NET, download, and run.

# Operation
Run the application. You will see this window:

The program is in off, or normal mode. It is not translating to cyrillic at this point. To turn on translation, click the button to the right.

Notice, the left button lights up and the titlebar changes to show the status of the application. The program is now in on, or translate mode and you can now type cyrillic characters.
